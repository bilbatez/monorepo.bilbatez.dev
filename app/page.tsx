        My real name however, is Albert. And I'm just your average friendly neighbourhood programmer! Most of the time, my work involves in making and maintaining websites.
        Whether it's the front facing side (the visuals you see on a site) or the back end side (which handles the operational side of things).

        Currently, I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/" target="_blank"><span className="text-sky-600">[Bank of America]</span></a> in Singapore. 
        In the past I've worked for <a href="https://www.shopee.sg/" target="_blank"><span className="text-sky-600">[Shopee]</span></a> and <a href="https://www.blibli.com" target="_blank"><span className="text-sky-600">[Blibli]</span></a>.
