Hey-hey people! nice to meet ya. I go with the alias _Bilbatez_ on the net, and welcome to my central hub!

However, my real name is ~̸̷̷̛̭̰͓͚̞̹̂ͨ̔́͌́́̅͐ͯ̉̾̆͘ͅ â̶͇̘̗̠̱̖͔̈ͫ̒ͫ͗̑͂͑ͦ͡͞ ḻ̷̢͔͖͗͑ͦ͆̏̒̚͢͡͠ b̵̩̣̓͑̇̓͋͆̚͟ ẹ̷̦̐̓̂̆͟ r̷̻͍̯͙̓͒̃̆*̸̷̡̼̼̬͉͈̠̟̦̘͂̿́ͤ̇ͦ̅͟͡ t̡̛̩̥̙̞̜̲ͦ̂̄̅̾̎̉̑̕͠͡*̱̟̞͕̃ͮͨ͛ͩ͘͠ ~̡̳̤̠̦̜͓̠͉̥͓̳̘͇̊̃̒͐ͨ̓͌̇̌̊̓̓́̃̐͊ͫ͘͠͞ , and I'm just your friendly neighborhood programmer! Most my work involves developing and maintaining application features across various platforms.

Currently, I'm a software engineer for [Bank of America](https://www.bankofamerica.com/) in Singapore. Previously, I worked in the e-commerce sector for [Shopee](https://www.shopee.sg) in Singapore and [Blibli](https://www.blibli.com) in Indonesia.

I strive to be an agnostic programmer, someone who masters the core concepts rather than just memorizing syntaxes. Because of this you'll find a lot of weird small projects in my Github repository.

Well... that's all, folks! Say hi whenever through my socials. I'll ignore spams though hehe ;)
