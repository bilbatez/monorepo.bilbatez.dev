Here are some projects that I've worked on!

- [Fake](https://github.com/bilbatez/fake): a cli program to generate fake data using FakerJS as the generator engine. I made this to mock some data for myself.
- [THIS Website](https://bilbatez.dev): HEHE
- [KPR for Dummies](https://kprfordummies.bilbatez.dev): Home mortgage calculator for Indonesians. I found mortgage calculation to be confusing.

- [Random Rust Projects](https://github.com/bilbatez/rusty-mini-projects): Why did I try to learn Rust?? Oh yea, the new cool kid in town
- [Random Javascript Projects](https://github.com/bilbatez/miniature-javascript-projects): Well I just got bored midway I think...
